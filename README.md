# Diamond Price Prediction Model

## Overview
This is a Diamond Price Prediction Model built using Decision Tree Regressor. The model aims to predict the price of diamonds based on various features such as carat weight, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from Kaggle and consists of diamond data collected from various sources. The dataset contains information about the carat weight, cut quality, color, clarity, dimensions, and price of diamonds.

You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/karnikakapoor/diamond-price-prediction).

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Install the required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## Usage
1. Load the diamond dataset into your Python environment.
2. Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features as necessary.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Train the Decision Tree Regressor model on the training data.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) score.
6. Make predictions on new data or the testing set using the trained model.
7. Visualize the results and compare predicted prices with actual prices to assess the model's accuracy.

## Model Evaluation
- The model's performance can be evaluated using various regression evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) score.
- Hyperparameter tuning techniques such as GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV can be used to optimize the model's performance further.
